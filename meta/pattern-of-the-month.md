# Pattern of the Month

We are constantly improving the [InnerSourcePatterns repo](https://github.com/InnerSourceCommons/InnerSourcePatterns), by asking the community to contribute their experience to existing patterns, and create entirely new patterns.

However with 40+ patterns in various maturity levels, it can be hard for new people to figure out where to get started.

With the **â€ŒPattern of the Month** we are putting the focus on one of the existing pattern at a time, allowing the community to learn more about this one pattern together.

## How could that work?

* Each month we pick on new **pattern of the month**. This can be a pattern of any [maturity level](contributor-handbook.md).
* We advertise for the pattern of the month on various channels:
    * twitter
    * linkedin
    * #innersource-patterns slack channel (maybe in #general as well)
    * we ask the Marketing Working Group to help us with this
* We moderate discussions about the pattern:
    * **Q&A sessions** (async) in #innersource-patterns (Slack)
    * **Video conferences** (live) with people who know the pattern well (the authors and contributors) to help describe nuances of the pattern and to help the audience determine what additional tweaks might make the pattern work in their context.
* We ask the community for contributions:
    * Discuss the pattern and ask questions about it #innersource-patterns (Slack).
    * Fix spelling, formatting, or other glitches that you notice in the pattern.
    * If you are using this pattern in your company, you could add a short description of how you are applying it to the **Known Instances** section.

## Objectives

* Help the community to learn about this pattern together.
* Improve the content of the pattern by tapping into the collective knowledge of the community.
* Help new people to contribute to the pattern. By doing so we will also learn how we can simplify our contribution process.

## History of Patterns of the Month

*Note:* We haven't actually announce any pattern of the month yet. So the below are just candidates that we are considering as the first one.

* [Start as an Experiment](https://innersourcecommons.gitbook.io/innersource-patterns/patterns/start-as-experiment) - Many companies that have started some type of InnerSource program will have experiences with getting such a program of the ground. It can be assumed that many started with some sort of experiment.
* [Trusted Committers](https://innersourcecommons.gitbook.io/innersource-patterns/patterns/start-as-experiment) - This seems like a frequently used pattern.
